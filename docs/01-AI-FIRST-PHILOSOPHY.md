## AI-First for ING Junior Profile (Ages 13-17)

### Core Philosophy
The Junior profile treats Leo as a **financial mentor and gaming companion**. Every interaction is designed to educate while entertaining, making financial literacy feel like an adventure.

### AI-First Principles for Junior

#### 1. Learning is Primary - Every Screen is a Learning Opportunity
- **Stock View**: Leo explains what a stock is, why prices change, and offers mini-quizzes
- **Salary Arrival**: Leo breaks down taxes and deductions with interactive animations
- **Portfolio View**: Leo congratulates or encourages based on performance, explains diversification
- **Every Button Press**: Leo contextually explains what will happen before confirming actions

**Example Interaction:**
```
Junior taps "Buy Apple Stock"

Leo appears: "Great choice! 🍎 Apple is a tech company that makes 
iPhones and MacBooks. Did you know they have more cash than most 
countries? Before we buy, let me check if this fits your portfolio..."

[Leo shows portfolio balance wheel]

Leo: "You already have 40% in tech stocks. Buying Apple would make 
it 55%. That's a lot of eggs in one basket! 🧺

Want to:
[ ] Buy anyway (I understand the risk)
[ ] Learn about diversification first
[ ] See other stock suggestions"
```

#### 2. Leo Guides Everything - No Dead-Ends
- Every screen has a Leo help bubble
- If user is inactive for 30 seconds, Leo offers assistance
- Error states always include Leo's explanation and solution
- Navigation suggestions based on user's apparent goal

**Example - User Confusion Detection:**
```
[User opens stock screen, scrolls up and down, exits, comes back]

Leo gently appears: "Looking for something specific? 🔍

Common questions:
• How do I buy my first stock?
• What's the safest investment for beginners?
• Show me trending stocks today

Or just tell me what you're curious about!"
```

#### 3. Proactive Education - Leo Notices and Acts
- **Pattern Detection**: "You've been checking crypto prices every day. Want a quick lesson on why crypto is volatile?"
- **Milestone Celebration**: "🎉 Your portfolio just hit €500! That's more than most adults have invested!"
- **Risk Warning**: "You've made 5 trades today. Real investors often wait weeks between trades. Let me explain why patience pays..."
- **News Context**: "Apple dropped 5% today. Here's what happened and why it might not be as scary as it looks..."

#### 4. Gamified AI - Leo Turns Concepts into Challenges
- Every financial concept becomes a quest
- Leo creates personalized challenges based on user's weak areas
- Achievement unlocks tied to real learning milestones
- Leaderboard positions tied to knowledge demonstration, not just points

**Example - Weekly Challenge:**
```
Leo's Weekly Quest: "The Diversification Master" 🏆

Your portfolio is 80% tech stocks. This week's challenge:
□ Research one non-tech company (50 XP)
□ Add a non-tech stock to watchlist (30 XP)
□ Complete the "Sectors & Industries" quiz (75 XP)
□ Make your portfolio at least 3 different sectors (100 XP + Badge!)

Time remaining: 4 days
Current XP from this quest: 0/255
```

#### 5. Safe Exploration - Virtual Money + Real AI Guidance
- All money is virtual but behavior is real
- Consequences exist (no "reset" button)
- Leo warns before risky decisions but allows learning from mistakes
- Post-mistake analysis: "Let's understand what happened and how to avoid it next time"

**Example - Learning from Loss:**
```
[User lost 30% on a volatile stock]

Leo: "Ouch! That was a tough one. 📉

Let's break down what happened:
1. GameStop is what we call a 'meme stock' - very unpredictable
2. You bought when it was high, which is common for beginners
3. The good news? This was virtual money, and you learned something real!

What would you have done differently?
[ ] Waited for a lower price
[ ] Researched the company more
[ ] Not put so much in one stock
[ ] All of the above

(Choose one - I'll explain the best strategy!)"
```

#### 6. Natural Language First - No Banking Jargon Required
- Teens can type/speak naturally
- Leo translates jargon into simple terms
- No forms - just conversation
- Questions are encouraged, never punished

**Example - Jargon Translation:**
```
User: "What's a P/E ratio?"

Leo: "Great question! 🧠

P/E stands for 'Price-to-Earnings' ratio. Think of it like this:

Imagine you want to buy a lemonade stand.
• The stand costs €100 (the Price)
• It makes €10 profit per year (the Earnings)
• P/E = 100 ÷ 10 = 10

That means it takes 10 years to 'earn back' what you paid.

Lower P/E = Cheaper for what you get 🏷️
Higher P/E = More expensive (but maybe worth it for growth!) 🚀

Apple's P/E is about 28. That means investors believe Apple 
will grow a lot to justify the price!

[Try it yourself! What's the P/E if price is €200 and earnings is €5?]"
```

## AI-First for ING Adult Profile (Ages 18-29)

### Core Philosophy
The Adult profile treats Leo as a **financial co-pilot**. Leo handles routine tasks, surfaces important insights, and helps users make informed decisions without the cognitive load of traditional banking.

### AI-First Principles for Adult

#### 1. Intelligent Automation - Leo Predicts and Suggests
- **Recurring Payments**: "It's the 1st. Rent (€800) usually due. Send to Landlord?"
- **Savings Automation**: "You have €500 extra this month. Move €300 to savings?"
- **Bill Negotiation Prep**: "Your electricity provider increased prices 12%. I found 3 cheaper alternatives."
- **Investment Rebalancing**: "Your portfolio drifted 8% from target. Rebalance with 2 clicks?"

**Example - Smart Transfer Suggestion:**
```
[First of the month, 9:00 AM]

Push notification: "🏠 Rent reminder from Leo"

User opens app:

Leo: "Good morning! Based on your history:
• Rent to Max Müller: €800
• Due: Usually by the 3rd
• Your balance: €3,456 ✓

[Slide to send €800 →]

Or tell me if something changed this month."
```

#### 2. Contextual Insights - Information When It Matters
- Insights appear on relevant screens, not buried in reports
- Spending alerts as they happen, not end of month
- Investment news tied to owned stocks
- Tax implications before transactions, not after

**Example - Real-Time Spending Alert:**
```
[User just paid €45 at a restaurant]

Leo appears subtly at bottom of screen:
"Dining out this week: €127 💸
That's 40% more than usual. 

Want me to track this more closely?
[Yes, set alert] [No, enjoying life!]"
```

#### 3. Document Intelligence - Instant Understanding
- Scan any document, get instant explanation
- Contract terms highlighted and explained
- Comparison with market rates
- Action items extracted automatically

**Example - Contract Scan:**
```
User scans electricity contract:

Leo: "I've analyzed your new contract 📄

Key terms:
✅ Fixed rate: €0.32/kWh (market avg: €0.35) - Good deal!
⚠️ 24-month lock-in period
⚠️ Price increase clause after year 1 (up to 8%)
❌ €50 cancellation fee

Compared to your current plan:
• You'll save ~€15/month initially
• But could cost more after year 1

My recommendation: Take it, but set a reminder for month 11 
to review prices.

[Accept & Save] [Ask me more] [Compare alternatives]"
```

#### 4. Conversational Banking - Natural Task Completion
- No forms, no menus - just tell Leo what you need
- Multi-step tasks handled in conversation
- Confirmations are clear and simple
- Errors explained with solutions

**Example - Natural Transfer:**
```
User types: "Send 50 euros to mom for her birthday"

Leo: "Happy birthday to your mom! 🎂

Sending €50 to:
📱 Mama (Sabine Meyer)
   DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00

Reference: Birthday gift 🎁

[Confirm with Face ID]

Or say 'change' to modify anything."
```

#### 5. Proactive Financial Health - Leo Alerts Before Problems
- Cash flow predictions: "Based on upcoming bills, you'll be short €200 on the 15th"
- Unusual activity: "I noticed a €500 charge from a website you've never used"
- Opportunity detection: "Your emergency fund hit €5,000! Ready to start investing?"
- Subscription monitoring: "You paid €12.99 for HBO Max but haven't watched it in 6 weeks"

**Example - Cash Flow Warning:**
```
Leo notification (5 days before payday):

"⚠️ Heads up!

Upcoming in the next 5 days:
• Rent: €800 (auto-transfer)
• Netflix: €12.99
• Insurance: €89

Current balance: €950

You'll be €52 short after rent goes out.

Options:
[ ] Move €100 from savings (instant)
[ ] Delay Netflix by 3 days
[ ] Contact landlord for extension
[ ] Show me other options"
```

#### 6. Smart Notifications - Actionable, Not Annoying
- Every notification has clear action
- Frequency adapts to user preference
- Important alerts break through, routine ones batch
- Easy one-tap resolution

**Example - Bundled Daily Summary:**
```
Evening notification: "Your daily finance snapshot 📊"

Opening reveals:
• Spent today: €47.50 (Groceries €32, Coffee €5.50, Transport €10)
• Budget status: 68% of weekly budget used (on track ✓)
• Portfolio: +0.8% today 📈
• Action needed: Confirm gym membership renewal (€29.99)

## Future Enhancements: Personalized UI (Long-term Vision)

> **Note**: This section describes a future vision (2-3 years out) that requires significant technical investment but represents the ultimate AI-first experience.

### Concept: User-Adaptive Interface

The ultimate AI-first banking app adapts not just content but **structure and layout** to each user:

#### Adaptive Elements
1. **Button Placement**: Most-used actions move to thumb-reach positions
2. **Color Schemes**: Subtle adjustments based on time of day and user preference
3. **Information Density**: Detail level adjusts to user's financial literacy
4. **Navigation Structure**: Frequently accessed screens become shortcuts
5. **Widget Priority**: Dashboard cards reorder based on relevance

#### Implementation Considerations
- **User Control Required**: Users must consent and can always reset to default
- **Gradual Changes**: No sudden UI shifts; changes happen slowly over time
- **Familiar Core**: Core ING branding and navigation remain consistent
- **Easy Toggle**: "Switch to default view" always available
- **Learning Period**: System needs 2-4 weeks of usage data before adapting

#### Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1 (Now): Static profiles (Junior/Adult)
- Phase 2 (6 months): Minor personalizations (widget order)
- Phase 3 (12 months): Adaptive shortcuts and highlights
- Phase 4 (24 months): Full adaptive UI with user controls
